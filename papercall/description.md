Open-science is a promissing trend of doing sciences with new open-source
methods and tools. There are a lot of ways to do open-science and many things
are still to be invented. The open-science movement is strong but there are
also strong reluctances and obstacles. In particular, one ot the major problems
is the lack of knowledge on programming methods and tools of most of
scientists and technicians.

Python and its scientific ecosystem is one of the main tools for
open-science. Great advantages of the Python language for science are to be easy
to learn and very generalist. Python is good for most of the tasks that need to
be done for research and teaching. Python skills increase employability for
students and working with Python links to the world of software development
much more than working with other specialized tools like Matlab and Labview.

I will present and discuss the work of scientific pythoners to foster
open-source software, Python and open-science in the field of fluid
dynamics. We are still at the beginning of this dynamics in my field. I will
present how we work on Python and programming trainings for scientists. We also
try to produce at the same time than our scientifics results, specialized
frameworks for research and teaching with Python. In 2014, we launched the
project FluidDyn, which supports the development of a set of Python packages
for laboratory experiments (fluidlab), numerical simulations (fluidfft,
fluidsim) and data processing (fluidimage). I will present some of the nicest
features of these packages (in particular those using cutting-edge Python
tools) and how we use these packages in real research to do open fluid
dynamics.
