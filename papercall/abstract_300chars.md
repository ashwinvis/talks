Open-source software and open-science in the field of fluid dynamics is an
emerging trend which ensures transparency in reported results and promotes
sustainable, robust code development. We introduce project FluidDyn,
launched in 2014, to foster the development of Python packages in teaching
and research with laboratory experiments, simulations and data processing.
